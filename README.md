# electoral-college

Creates VERY simple projections for each state / county based on the current
percentage of total votes in and the current number of votes each candidate has.

Run like this: `go run main.go nevada` or `go run main.go new-mexico`.

Uses the (unpublished?) API that MSNBC / NBC News uses to update their websites.
